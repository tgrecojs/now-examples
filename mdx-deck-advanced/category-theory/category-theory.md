##It's really that simple. If you're a skeptic like me, then you might be having a hard time buying this. Just sit tight though it will all make sense soon.

### Personal Experience
I'm going to let you in on a secret before this post begins. Prior to being introduced to FP, I was hardly an academic. I enjoyed programming *but that was different*, or so I thought. Then I became introduced to FP and the next thing i knew I had developed a bit of an obsession with math. 

Now, you don't have to become as interested as I am in it, but I say all of this just in-case you happen to be a person like myself, who was never really "good at school". Pardon my language but put all of that bullshit behind you. I strongly believe that having a moderate interest in this stuff is half the battle. I know from first-hand experience. It might take some hard-work but trust me, it will all be worth it. Also, feel free to reach out to me. 

### Intro
In my post on functors I mentioned  that functional programming has roots in category theory. Well, I was actually being a bit modest. Why? Well, it's easy to have a negative response to the fact that functional programming is essentially math. I didn't want to taint that for you. If you're reading this however, then i'd be willing to bet that it doesn't bother you that much. But enough about that, let's dive in.

### Understanding the Core Concepts of Category Theory
There are two terms that we need to learn in order to understand category theory - **Categories** and **Morphisms***. 

* **Category**: 
    * A collection of objects and morphisms, or arrows, which connect one object to another.
    * In regards to JavaScript, we can think of categories as sets consisting of one or more element where an element can be any data type.  
* **Morphisms**: 
    * Arrows, or functions, that transform one object to another. 
    * Keep in mind that **morphisms must be pure** in order to preserve the structure of the category which it is acting on.

The abstract nature of category theory makes its a tremendous tool for composition, however there are some rules that we need to follow. (If you read my post on functors then you already know these rules)

1. Identity:
    * All categories must have identity morphism that map back to the same object.
2. Composition:
    * Given the connected object X → Y → Z, there must be a composition for going directly from X → Z.
    * Composition is associative. 




> Category theory and function composition go together like engine displacement and horsepower, like NASA and the space shuttle, like good beer and a mug to pour it in. Basically, you can't have one without the other.

I didn't harp on this because it is easy to have a negative response 

he negative response fact that we're essentially learning math because

Functional Programming is deeply rooted in category theory - here are its basics:
